# Matrix Multiplication Benchmarking Project

This project provides a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of matrix multiplication across four programming languages: Python, Java, C++, and Rust. The objective is to evaluate performance in terms of execution time, memory usage, and CPU utilization for different matrix sizes, simulating real-world challenges in Big Data applications.

## Cover Page:

- *Subject:* Big Data (BD)
- *Academic Year:* 2024-2025
- *Degree:* Data Science and Engineering (GCID)
- *School:* School of Computer Engineering (EII)
- *University:* University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC)


## Development Environment:

- *Development Environments*: PyCharm, IntelliJ, CLion, RustRover and Bash of a Virtual Machine Fedora (1 CPU and 2048 MB).
- *Version Control*: Git & GitHub for source code management and collaboration.

 ## Folder Structure

The repository contains five main folders, each corresponding to a programming language, along with a utilities folder:

- **C++**:
  - `shared_folder`: Contains text files generated by scripts.
  - `Scripts`: Contains the `perf_execution` script to execute matrix multiplication code for different matrix sizes.
  - `Matrix_Multiplication`: Implements the matrix multiplication function.
  - `Matrix_Multiplication_With_CPU_And_Memory`: A CLion project that provides information on memory usage, CPU consumption, and execution time.

- **Rust**:
  - Follows a similar structure to the C++ folder with code tailored for Rust.

- **Java**:
  - `shared_folder`: Functions similarly to the C++ shared folder.
  - `scripts`: Contains scripts that perform the same functions as in the C++ and Rust folders.
  - `Matrix_Multiplication`: Similar functionality as in the C++ and Rust folders.
  - `Benchmark`: Divided into:
    - `MatrixMultiplicationJava`: Code utilizing benchmarking tools in an IntelliJ project.
    - `MultipleAlgorithmMultiplication`: Contains multiple algorithms with an interface for benchmarking.

- **Python**:
  - Mirrors the Java folder structure, with a benchmark project dedicated to matrix multiplication.

- **Utils**:
  - Contains a PyCharm project named `Graphs Generator`, which includes utilities for extracting data and generating graphs.
