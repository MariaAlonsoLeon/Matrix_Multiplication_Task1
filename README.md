# Matrix Multiplication Benchmarking Project

This project provides a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of matrix multiplication across four programming languages: Python, Java, C++, and Rust. The objective is to evaluate performance in terms of execution time, memory usage, and CPU utilization for different matrix sizes, simulating real-world challenges in Big Data applications.

## Cover Page:

- *Subject:* Big Data (BD)
- *Academic Year:* 2024-2025
- *Degree:* Data Science and Engineering (GCID)
- *School:* School of Computer Engineering (EII)
- *University:* University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC)


## Development Environment:

- *Development Environments*: PyCharm, IntelliJ, CLion, RustRover and Bash of a Virtual Machine Fedora (1 CPU and 2048 MB).
- *Version Control*: Git & GitHub for source code management and collaboration.

 ## Folder Structure

The repository contains five main folders, each corresponding to a programming language, along with a utilities folder:

- **C++**:
  - `shared_folder`: Contains text files generated by scripts.
  - `Scripts`: Contains the `perf_execution` script to execute matrix multiplication code for different matrix sizes.
  - `Matrix_Multiplication`: Implements the matrix multiplication function.
  - `Matrix_Multiplication_With_CPU_And_Memory`: A CLion project that provides information on memory usage, CPU consumption, and execution time.

- **Rust**:
  - Follows a similar structure to the C++ folder with code tailored for Rust.

- **Java**:
  - `shared_folder`: Functions similarly to the C++ shared folder.
  - `scripts`: Contains scripts that perform the same functions as in the C++ and Rust folders.
  - `Matrix_Multiplication`: Similar functionality as in the C++ and Rust folders.
  - `Benchmark`: Divided into:
    - `MatrixMultiplicationJava`: Code utilizing benchmarking tools in an IntelliJ project.
    - `MultipleAlgorithmMultiplication`: Contains multiple algorithms with an interface for benchmarking.

- **Python**:
  - Mirrors the Java folder structure, with a benchmark project dedicated to matrix multiplication.

- **Utils**:
  - Contains a PyCharm project named `Graphs Generator`, which includes utilities for extracting data and generating graphs.

## Usage
- Open the respective IDE for the programming language you wish to test.
- Navigate to the appropriate folder and run the desired script or project.
- Use the Graphs Generator in the Utils folder to visualize the results obtained from the benchmarking.

## Key Results:

- Rust consistently outperforms other languages in execution speed but shows high memory and CPU consumption.
- Java offers a balanced performance, with near-optimal execution times and better resource management (lower memory and CPU usage).
- C++ demonstrates highly efficient memory usage and stable execution times, making it well-suited for performance-critical tasks.
- Python exhibits significant performance degradation, particularly for larger matrices, due to its interpreted nature and lack of low-level optimizations.

## Dependencies

### Python 
* `pytest` for benchmarking
*  `matplotlib` for graph generation
*  `psutil` for memory and CPU tracking
### Java 
* `JMH` (Java Microbenchmark Harness) for benchmarking
*  `ManagementFactory` for system resource tracking
 ## C++ 
 * Standard C++ libraries (`iostream`, `chrono`, `psapi.h`)
### Rust 
* `sysinfo` crate for system resource tracking

## How to Run the Benchmarks

### Python
1. Navigate to the `Python/Benchmark/` folder.
2. Run the benchmark using pytest:
    ```bash
    pytest --benchmark-only
    ```

### Java
1. Navigate to the `Java/MatrixMultiplicationJava/` folder.
2. Use Maven or your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ) to run the JMH benchmarks:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

### C++
1. Navigate to the `C++/Scripts/` folder.
2. Use the provided scripts to compile and run the benchmarks:
    ```bash
    g++ -o benchmark matrix_multiplication.cpp
    ./benchmark
    ```

### Rust
1. Navigate to the `Rust/Matrix_Multiplication/` folder.
2. Compile and run the benchmark:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```
Additionally, the scripts can be used with the command `./perf_execution.sh`, this will generate one text book for each matrix size.

## Results

The benchmarking results include:
- **Execution Time (ms)**: Measured for each matrix size.
- **Memory Usage (MB)**: Memory consumption recorded during matrix operations.
- **CPU Usage (%)**: CPU utilization during benchmarking.

For a detailed analysis, the results are visualized using graphs in the `Utils/Graphs_Generator` folder.

## Future Work

Future enhancements to the project include:
- Implementation of optimized matrix multiplication algorithms like Strassen's algorithm.
- Exploring sparse matrix formats (e.g., CSR, CSC, COO) to improve performance.
- Testing larger matrix sizes and evaluating the impact of optimization techniques on performance.
